Void Ascension is a mod for Minecraft java edition, it adds a single dimension at this point, several items, and mobs. All the mob models are place holder, I will be revamping them in the 1.20.1 update. I strive to make the mod challenging, but also fun. I am a beginner in mod development and coding so things will be slow as I learn. I plan to add a lot more to the mod in the coming future, more dimensions, bosses, world events. Those are just a few things I have thought up, hope everyone enjoys the mod. All the information that will be needed on the mod will be here in the wiki, I will be updating it as time goes on.
