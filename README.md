News update on the next upcoming small update, I have been giving allot more time to developing the mod. Working on a feature that I have been wanting to add since the first beta release. It will be a decent change for the ones that have been playing since the initial release of the mod. When the update releases I will explain the major change in the changelog of the next upload. I can not be sure of the release date but it will be sometime soon, just as soon as I find the way to implement the last few parts of the update. On a sidenote I am working on a discord server for the mod so once it is done it will be added on the project page for curseforge, modrinth, and github. Well that is all for the update, thanks to everyone that has gave the mod a try, Have a good day or night.

Void Ascension is a mod for Minecraft java edition, it adds a single dimension at this point, several items, and mobs. All the mob models are place holder, I will be revamping them in the 1.20.1 update. I strive to make the mod challenging, but also fun. I am a beginner in mod development and coding so things will be slow as I learn. I plan to add a lot more to the mod in the coming future, more dimensions, bosses, world events. Those are just a few things I have thought up, hope everyone enjoys the mod. All the information that will be needed on the mod will be on the wiki, I will be updating it as time goes on.
